Also, the purpose for this document is described and a list of abbreviations and definitions is provided.\n\n\n1.1 Purpose\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the \"Giveaway\" software. It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the development of the system. It will also explain system constraints, interface and interactions with other external applications. \nThis document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval and a reference for developing the first version of the system for the development team.\n\n\n1.2 Scope\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe \"Giveaway\" is a web-based mobile application which creates a way for people to gift the things (clothes, shoes, coupons, gift cards, games...) they don't need or use anymore. All those things would go to people in need which are choosen based on the comment poll under each gift. Gifts are presented in the form of an image and a descroption. Anyone who would like to receive a certain gift leaves a comment with a reason why should they get it. The owner then pics the favorite comment and gift goes to that person. The application should be free to download from either a mobile phone application store or similar services. The application will also be avaliable as a web application.\n\n\nThe gift owners can provide their gift information using either the web or mobile application. This information will act as the bases for the search results displayed to the user. An administrator also uses the web application in order to administer the system and keep the information accurate. The administrator can, for instance, verify gift owners and manage user information.\n\n\nFurthermore, the software needs both Internet, to fetch and display results, and access to your camera in case you want to publish a new giveaway. All system information is maintained in a database, which is located on a web-server. The application also has the capability of representing both summary and detailed information about the users. Security system is custom made as it uses the custom made tokens.\n\n\n1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations\n\u00b6\n\n\nTable 1.
